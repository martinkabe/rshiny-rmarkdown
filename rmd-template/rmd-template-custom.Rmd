## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r airquality}
# ft_example <- fp_text_lite(
#   color = "red", bold = TRUE)
run_num <- run_autonum(seq_id = "tab", pre_label = "Table ", bkm = "iris_table", bkm_all = TRUE)
block_caption(
  label = "Airquality table",
  style = "caption",
  autonum = run_num
)
head(airquality)
# body_add_table(docx, title, pos = "before")
```

This is reference to `r run_reference(id = "iris_table")`.

## Including Plots

:::{custom-style="mystyle1"}
This is formatted according to the _mystyle1_ format.
:::

:::{custom-style="mystyle3"}
This format includes a border and it also works with an equation.
$$Y = bX + c$$
:::

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
